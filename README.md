> This is a minimal template for React applications using Vite JS. It is a template that can be used as a starting point for small projects.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed the latest version of Node.js
- You have installed the latest version of Yarn

## Installation and Setup

To install and setup the project, follow these steps:

Use degit to scaffold your project based on this template.

```sh
npx degit josenaldo/vite-js-react-minimal my-project
```

Where `my-project` is the name of your project.

Go to the project directory.

```sh
cd my-project
```

Install all dependencies of the project. Must be run once before other scripts, right after the clone or download.

```sh
yarn install
```

After installing all dependencies, you must configure the environment variables. You can use the `.env.example` file as a template.

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

## Scripts

### Dev

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

Run the application in development mode.

```sh
yarn dev
```

After running the application in development mode, you can access the application via the following URL:

- [http://localhost:PORT](http://localhost:PORT)

Where `PORT` is the port configured in the `.env` file. The default port is `3000`.

### Build

Builds the application for production to the `dist` folder.

```sh
yarn build
```

### Preview

Runs the application in production mode.

```sh
yarn preview
```

### Lint

Runs the ESLint linter on the source code files with `.js` and `.jsx`, extensions located in the `src` directory.

```sh
yarn lint
```

Runs the ESLint linter on the source code files with `.js`, and `.jsx`, extensions located in the `src` directory and automatically fix any fixable problems.

```sh
yarn lint:fix
```

### Deploy

Deploy the application to the production environment.

```sh
yarn deploy
```

### Test

Runs the Jest test runner on the source code files with `.test.js` and `.test.jsx`, extensions located in the `src` directory.

```sh
yarn test
```

Runs the Jest test runner on the source code files with `.test.js` and `.test.jsx`, extensions located in the `src` directory and watch for changes.

```sh
yarn test:watch
```

Runs the Jest test runner on the source code files with `.test.js` and `.test.jsx`, extensions located in the `src` directory and generate a coverage report.

```sh
yarn test:coverage
