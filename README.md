that introduces learners to modern web application development using
JavaScript. The course covers a wide range of topics including building
single-page applications using ReactJS, REST APIs built with Node.js, and
GraphQL. Participants will learn about testing, configuration, environment
management, and the use of databases for storing application data. The course
is free of charge and offers a certificate upon completion, as well as the
opportunity to earn 5-14 ECTS credits from the University of Helsinki.

The course is designed for individuals with good programming skills and basic
knowledge of web programming and databases, as well as familiarity with Git
version control. Participants are expected to have perseverance, independent
problem-solving skills, and the ability to seek out information when necessary.

The course has partnerships and affiliations with companies such as Houston
Inc, Terveystalo, Elisa, Unity Technologies, and Konecranes. Guest lectures by
experts from these companies are included in the course material. Participants
